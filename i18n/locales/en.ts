            Description: "Lahyra is my largest personal project. It was created using VueJS (JavaScript) for the frontend and Laravel for the backend (PHP). This project includes many advanced features that make it robust and secure. - First, let's talk about authentication protected by JWT (JSON Web Token). JWT is a very popular authentication mechanism used in modern web applications. The main advantage of JWT is that it allows authentication state to be maintained on the client side, meaning the server does not need to store authentication states for each user. Instead, when a user successfully logs in, they receive a JWT token containing encoded credentials. This token is then included in each request sent to the server, allowing the server to verify the user's authenticity and permissions with each request. - Regarding language management with I18n, this allows Lahyra to support multiple languages. This is an important feature for applications used by an international audience, as it allows users to choose their preferred language. Thanks to this feature, the texts and messages displayed to the user can be easily and dynamically translated, offering a more personalized experience.- Image uploading with storage is another key feature of Lahyra. It allows users to upload images to the site. These images are then securely stored on a server or an appropriate storage service. This provides a convenient solution for users who wish to share photos or images as part of their use of Lahyra.- Another essential integration in Lahyra is WebSocket with Pusher. WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that enables real-time communication between the client and server. The use of WebSocket in Lahyra allows for instant, real-time updates without needing to reload the page. This provides a more responsive user experience, especially for features that require real-time updates, such as notifications or live chats.- By clicking on 'API Routes,' you can access a list of all routes working on the site. Some of these routes are protected by admin permissions, meaning they are only accessible to users with administrator privileges. This security measure ensures that certain sensitive or restricted features can only be used by authorized users, strengthening the overall security of the application.",

            Description: "My portfolio is a personal project created using VueJS (JavaScript) with Vuetify. VueJS is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and Vuetify is a UI component library that provides ready-to-use components following Material Design guidelines. Together, VueJS and Vuetify offer a powerful combination for developing attractive and interactive web applications. - To enhance the portfolio’s functionality, various libraries have been incorporated. One of them is I18n, which stands for Internationalization. I18n allows for easy translation and localization of the portfolio into multiple languages. This feature is essential for reaching a broader audience and providing a personalized experience for users who prefer different languages. - To manage HTTP requests, the portfolio uses Axios, a widely used JavaScript library. Axios simplifies the process of making asynchronous HTTP requests, such as retrieving data from APIs or sending data to a server. - To ensure smooth navigation within the portfolio, Vue Router is used. Vue Router is the official routing library for VueJS, enabling the creation of single-page applications with multiple views or pages. By using Vue Router, the portfolio can have distinct routes for different sections, allowing users to navigate between pages without needing to reload the entire site. - In addition to functional aspects, the portfolio also features a dark mode system. Dark mode offers an alternative color scheme using darker colors, which can be easier on the eyes, reduce eye strain, and save battery life. To ensure a seamless user experience, the selected mode (dark or light) is stored in the browser’s local storage. This means that even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser, the portfolio remembers their preferred mode and applies it consistently.",

            Description: "EasySave is a file backup software. It was a school project developed by a team of four students, in which I was responsible for software development, using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. - To successfully complete this project, we used several tools and technologies. We worked with Visual Studio 2022 (Enterprise edition), a powerful and versatile integrated development environment. Visual Studio enabled us to create a robust and functional application by providing advanced debugging, version control, and third-party tool integration features. - To design and model our application, we used Visual Paradigm, a visual modeling tool. With this tool, we were able to create class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other models to plan and organize our development process. - For source code management and team collaboration, we used Azure Repos, a Git repository hosting service provided by Microsoft. This allowed us to collaborate efficiently, track code changes, and manage branches and versions effectively. - EasySave was developed in its 1.0 version, marking the initial release of the software. Throughout the development process, we aimed to create a user-friendly interface while ensuring the reliability and security of file backups. - This project was a valuable experience for me, as it allowed me to acquire skills in software development, teamwork collaboration, and the use of modern development tools. I was able to apply MVVM principles, which promote a clear separation of concerns between business logic, presentation, and data management.",

            Description: "My first Discord bot is a project I undertook to learn JavaScript programming and explore application development on the Discord platform. To create this bot, I used the Discord.js library, which is specifically designed to interact with the Discord API. - I started by creating a bot account on the Discord Developer Portal, which allowed me to obtain a unique authentication token. This token is used by my bot to connect to Discord as a distinct entity. - Next, I set up my development environment by installing Node.js, a platform that allows JavaScript applications to run server-side. Node.js enabled me to launch my bot as a standalone application capable of responding to events and commands on Discord servers. - Using Discord.js, I was able to create custom functionalities for my bot. For example, I implemented the 'interaction' command, which allows server administrators to see interactions happening. - Another command I added is 'ban,' which enables banning a server member. This command accepts two options: 'member' to specify the user to ban, and 'reason' for an optional explanation. - I also included the 'github' command, which displays a link to my source code on GitHub, and the 'server' command, which allows users to view various server information. - To add a fun aspect to my bot, I created the 'al' command, which lets users play the game 'The Price is Right.' This command accepts the 'number' option, allowing users to choose a number. - Another feature I implemented is the 'pof' command, which lets users play 'Heads or Tails.' - The 'covid' command allows users to select data related to the Covid-19 pandemic. This command fetches updated data from an external API using the fetch function to retrieve information about Covid deaths, ICU cases, hospitalizations, or confirmed cases. Users can choose from these options using the 'data' parameter. - The bot also includes the 'nasa' command, which displays NASA's picture of the day. To achieve this, I used an external API providing NASA's daily images, again using fetch to retrieve data. - Lastly, I added the 'announcement' command, allowing users to publish an announcement. This command accepts a 'message' option where the user can enter the announcement content. - Through this project, I gained a better understanding of JavaScript and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. I also explored the Discord API, interactive bot development, and external API integration to enhance my bot’s features.",
